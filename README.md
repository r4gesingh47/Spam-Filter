# Spam-Filter
A basic project on identifying spam mail using Machine Learning  

### **Notebook** -`jupyter notebook file contains how I trained the model`  
### **Deployment** - `Contains the pickled model and flask application to run the web application.`  
**Open terminal in deployment folder**  
**Commands**  
_`flask run`_  
**If gives error then _`export FLASK_APP=main.py`_**  
**Try running again**  

### **Issues**  
Is able to detect only the trained data as the dataset was small
